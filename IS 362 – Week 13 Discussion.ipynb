    "##### 1. Identify a recommender system web site.\n",
    "The web site I chose is ebay a e-commerce online buying and selling web site. Ebay has been around since 1995 and since than they have been successful. Ebay I believe number one web site who came up with auction based selling through web site and it's been like this until now. After carefully reviewing ebay, I found that ebay uses recently viewed, upcoming holiday deals, seasonal deals and featured deals recommender system. However, I notice that ebay doesn't use collaborative filtering, most viewed items, mostly purchased and currently fast bidding items recommenders systems which will encourage users to click on the deal and bid."
